## Description

This Gem has the purpose to generate PDF reports from the **CDISC** HTML reports and making it in a short time as possible, even for large files.

The tool has the capacity to receive dynamic content like from a dynamically generated HTML view, which fed it from a form in precedence and transform that to a PDF. It has a specific layout in the Gem itself to conditionally submit form updates.

The Gem has the inbuilt capability to replace relative paths for assets to their absolute paths as it is required while rendering HTML as a string using **wkhtmltopdf** binary.

It has the feature to just take template name in case of static HTML reports pdf generation. Just place files in public folder in case of rails rack app and on providing a template file name to Gem instance.

No deadlock to single server processing. Reduced extra HTTP requests using resources within provided HTML and remove cross-domain URLs when rendering pdf requires wkhtmltopdf to hit your server again (for images, js, css)
